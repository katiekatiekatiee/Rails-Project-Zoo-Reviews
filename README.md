# Rails Zoo Reviews

Thank you for using Zoo Reviews! Here, you can create an account with your unique email address and password, or sign in through either Facebook or Google. Once logged in, a user can view all reviews left for all of the zoos entered into the database, or add a new zoo to review. The full list of both zoos and U.S. states are also available to a user to provide different ways of displaying the data and different ways of contributing data by either adding a new zoo, a new review, or both. A user can only edit and delete the reviews they have contributed, all of which can be found on their profile. Ultimately, a user is also advised to log out of the application.

## Installation

Fork and clone this repository in your terminal. 
Navigate into the file in the terminal and open it.

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Then enter the following into the terminal and view in your browser:

    $ rails s


## Usage

Once the file is open in a text editor, run "bundle install" to ensure the application's gem dependencies have been downloaded. Then, enter "rails s" into the terminal to open a server and view the application in the browser as "localhost."

From there, you will be directed first to the Welcome Page. Here, either sign up or log in with your email, Google, or Facebook account.

Once logged in, you are first directed to a full list of zoos that have been entered into the database already. To add a new zoo, either choose the state it belongs to or add the zoo directly from the location's profile. There you are also able to add a review simultaneously. There is an option to edit or delete an entry on each review's page, but be advised you may only edit or delete the reviews listed on your own profile. All users' reviews are accessible for viewing under the "All Reviews" link in the navigation bar.

To log out of the application, click the "log out" button, also located in the navigation bar. 

## Development

After reviewing the repo, run `bundle install` to install gem dependencies.
